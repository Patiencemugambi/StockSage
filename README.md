# StockSage: Empowering Efficient Inventory Management

## Project Description
StockSage is a web-based application developed to address the challenges businesses face in managing and accurately documenting their inventory or stock quantities. It provides a solution for businesses to easily track, record, and manage their stock levels and inventory.

## Features
- User Registration and Authentication: Implement a secure user registration and authentication system to ensure authorized access to StockSage.
- Stock Item Management: Enable businesses to add, edit, and delete stock items. The system allows for storing details such as name, description, quantity, and category of each stock item.
- Stock Quantity Tracking: Allow users to update and track stock quantities in real-time, providing an accurate overview of available inventory.

## JSON Server
This project utilizes a JSON server hosted at https://fake-server-jhcl.onrender.com/ to simulate an API for managing stock items. The JSON server provides endpoints for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting stock items.

Please refer to the [JSON server documentation](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for information on how to interact with the API.
